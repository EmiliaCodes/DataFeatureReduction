# DataFeatureReduction
A simple project in which I deep into data reduction algorithms.

You'll see neural networks created in Pytorch, and various algorithms for data dimension reduction - FRESH, RFE, analysis of correlation, RandomForestClassifier. I managed to get more than 90% accuracy with just 3 out of 783 features.

The project is in polish, so if you need any help in translation - feel free to shoot me a message :)
